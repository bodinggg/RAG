# Fine tune by llamafactory
Two strategies are recommended for fine-tuning using llamafactory, the second one being:
1. Visualize parameter settings through the board interface
2. Use the YAML configuration file to execute llamafactory-cli train xxx.yaml

# RAG and APP
Build RAG through llamaindex and call the fine tuned model to execute Q&A.
Use streamlit for interactive interfaces.
